I've tried to compared airspeed of bird and insect from Birdscan (BS) data and Supermegafluss (SF).
SF data does not have enough insects so can't compare
The speed estimation from BS seems to be hugely variable with height and might not be very accurate. A more thourough understanding of the calculation and radar technology is needed before using this data.
